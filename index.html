   To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one's family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one's own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him.

    <p>
          The founder of Buddhism in this
    world is Buddha Shakyamuni. He was
    born as a royal prince in 624 BC in a
    place called Lumbini, which was
    originally in northern India but is now
    part of Nepal. â€˜Shakyaâ€™ is the name of
    the

    royal family into which he was born,
    and â€˜Muniâ€™ means â€˜Able Oneâ€™. His
    parents gave him the name Siddhartha
    and there were many wonderful
    predictions about his future. In his
    early years he lived as a prince in his
    royal palace but when he was 29 years
    old he retired to the forest where he
    followed a spiritual life of meditation.
    After six years he attained
    enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree in
    Bodh Gaya, India.
